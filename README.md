# Code Challange

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challenge Description

The challenge is to create two different routes inside the application “/table” and “/user” where:

"/table":

- You should be able to create a table and present the data coming from the backend in realtime. Each new data that arrives must be inserted into the table.
- The candidate must create a search input on the same page that will filter this information within the table.

An example that you can use for guidance:

<p>
    <img src="public/wireframe_01.png"  alt="Main"/> 
</p>

"/user":

- The candidate must create a card presenting the information of the connected user into the server.

An example that you can use for guidance:

<p>
    <img src="public/wireframe_02.png"  alt="Profile"/>
</p>

### Must have:
- use this repo as a boilerplate of your project 

- Use [Material-ui v5](https://mui.com/) for construct your components.

- [React/hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

- On the day of the interview you should have the project running on your local machine for a presentation.

## Additional information

- The backend is already built.
- You can use it as a data source, the client will be connected to the socket in real time. 
- You will receive in an interval of 0 and 10 seconds a new response with the financial data and you should use this information to build the table.
